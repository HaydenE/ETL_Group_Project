Opioids are a major issue within the US. It is a leading cause of deaths. In order to understand this problem in more detail, we analyzed deaths in the US due to opioids from the CDC, where these deaths are occurring, who is prescribing opioids all in order to see if there are patterns that may lead to explanations of why this is occurring. The is a bold task, as there may be many environmental, social economic, and other factors that may be involved that were not taken into consideration as part of this analysis. 
•	Largest State of Deaths: Ohio, 161K over a 5-year period
•	Deaths by year: Deaths are increasing year over year by about 10%, with 338K deaths in 2018 in the US
•	Region of country with most prescriptions: CA, then FL which leads us to believe geography is not a leading indicator. Ohio is the 4th largest state for prescriptions with highest death count. CA and FL did not make the top 5 death count, also leading to a loose indicator of prescriptions to deaths.
•	Dr Type prescribing opioids that led to most deaths: Male Drs are prescribing opioids 3x more than females. We don’t think this correlate to opioid deaths but rather just an interesting fact. 
•	Gender of Dr that prescribed opioids that led to most deaths: Family practice Drs are prescribing opioids at the largest rate with ~600K prescriptions. The CDC should conduct a study of why these prescriptions were made and if they were absolutely necessary.
The following describes the procedures we took through this exercise:
1.	We looked into data related to opioid deaths 
2.	We found a data set that describes prescribed medicine, deaths by state, what type of DR. can prescribe opioids, and then found deaths by state by opioid
3.	We then cleaned the data by ensuring that we can link by drug name, there were no null values, removed dupes, removed attributes that were not applicable to our data, cleaned like names, changed case of names.
4.	We then looked at the data attributes and started to think about the appropriate tables and primary keys to link the data.

Hayden: My part of this project focused on cleaning the data and preparing visualizations.
